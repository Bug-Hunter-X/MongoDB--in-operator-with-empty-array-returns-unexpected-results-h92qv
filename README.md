# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array. The issue is that an empty array will always result in an empty result set, regardless of whether the field exists in your documents.  This behavior can lead to unexpected results and potentially incorrect application logic.

The `bug.js` file demonstrates the incorrect usage, which produces an empty result set even when documents exist. The `bugSolution.js` shows how to correctly handle this case. This solution allows you to handle empty array inputs gracefully and avoid returning an empty set when you might expect results.
